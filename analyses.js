    analysis: `
      Croatia enters this qualifier as the clear favorite.  
      <br><br>✅ In their last two games, Croatia scored 12 goals (7–0 vs Gibraltar, 5–1 vs Czech Republic).  
      <br>✅ Faroe Islands, on the other hand, have lost 4 of their last 5 matches, conceding 7 goals in that span.  
      <br>✅ Even without a few regular starters, Croatia’s squad depth is on another level.  
      <br><br><b>Expected scenario:</b> Croatia dominates possession and creates plenty of chances against a defensive Faroe side.  
      <br><b>Prediction:</b> Comfortable win by 2–3 goals.
