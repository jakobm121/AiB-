    analysis: `
      Croatia comes into this match as the clear favorite despite missing a few regular starters.  
      <br><br>✅ They scored 12 goals in their last two matches (7–0 vs Gibraltar, 5–1 vs Czech Republic).  
      <br>✅ Faroe Islands have only 1 win in their last 5 and struggle against top opposition.  
      <br>✅ Croatia’s squad depth and attacking options are simply on another level.  
      <br><br><b>Expected Scenario:</b> Croatia dominates possession, creates plenty of chances and secures a comfortable win.  
      <br><b>Prediction:</b> Croatia should win by at least 2 goals.
